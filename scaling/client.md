The same client code in the root of the repository works here too.

Server is exposed at: http://localhost:8000

We can connect here from multiple consoles to get multiple clients.
We should be connected to the different servers (LB).

If we send any message from a client, it should be transmitted to every other clients connected to the same or different server.
